# Bank-Management-System-
It's a JAVA based project. We know Java is an Object Oriented Prgramming language which is develoled by Sun Microseystem. 
Here I have used Netbeans IDE. I have also used XAMPP for performing database. 
We know A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.
This is a desktop application where a user can login using his/her uniqe id and password. 
After logging into his/her profile he can be performed some operations like, withdraw,deposit,transfer, check balance etc.
